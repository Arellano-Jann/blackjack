        <h1>The Rules of Blackjack</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
        <h2>Dealer</h2>
        <p>The dealer will give each player two cards. One of the dealer's cards will be hidden until the end.</p>
        <h2>Player Turn</h2>
        <p>The player can then "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (end turn). If the player's cards total 21, they have "blackjacked" and won. If the player's cards total over 21, they have "busted" and lost.</p>
        <h2>Dealer Turn</h2>
        <p>When the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until their cards total 17 or more. If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the dealer gets 21, the dealer wins. If the player gets more points than the dealer without busting, the player wins.</p>
        <h2>Splitting</h2>
        <p>If the player's first two cards are of the same value, they can choose to split them into two hands. The player must then place an additional bet equal to the original bet. The dealer will give the player one additional card to each hand, and the player will then play out each hand individually. The player cannot split again.</p>
        <h2>Double Down</h2>
        <p>When the player's turn comes, they can choose to "double down", which means they can double their bet and only get one more card. The player must then stand.</p>
        <h2>Insurance</h2>
        <p>If the dealer's up card is an ace, the player can choose to take "insurance", which means they are betting that the dealer has blackjack. If the dealer does have blackjack, the player will be paid 2 to 1 on their insurance bet. Otherwise, the player loses their insurance bet.</p>
